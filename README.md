# QUANTUM SIMULATOR

This quantum simulator can process a text file in the format of a QASM program and simulate how a quantum circuit would process the instructions resulting in a final output in the form of a qubit state.

### Input

In the main method, simply copy the path from the miller_11.qasm file in the root folder and paste it into the File object on the first line of main().

### Run the simulator

With a Dart SDK simply run the main method by going to the Run tab in VS Code and run without debugging or in the command line type 'dart run simulator.dart'

### Output

The output can verified in the console.
